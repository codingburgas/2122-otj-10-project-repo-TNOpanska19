 * \file   pch.h
 * \brief  A precompiled header file. Files listed below are compiled only once, improving build performance for future builds.This also affects IntelliSense performance, including code completion and many code browsing features.However, files listed here are ALL re-compiled if any one of them is updated between builds. Do not add files here that you will be updating frequently as this negates the performance advantage.
